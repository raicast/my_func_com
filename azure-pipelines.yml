# Azure DevOps pipeline to build, check source codes, run tests, and deploy.
#
# To enable the check of source code with Danger JS you need to configure a valid
# GitHub token by setting the following variable: 
# - DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN
#
# The deployment can only be triggered by a manual run of the pipeline and consists 
# in publishing a new version of the package 'io-functions-commons' to the NPM 
# registry and create a corresponding release in GitHub. To enable the deployment 
# you need to set to true the following variable otherwise the job to release the 
# package will be skipped:
# - ENABLE_MANUAL_DEPLOY = true
#
# The following variable needs to be used for specifying the increment "major", "minor", 
# "patch", or "pre*" version of the package to be published (you could also directly 
# specify the version; e.g. "4.2.1"):
# - PACKAGE_VERSION
# 
# To publish a Release to the GitHub repository you need to specify in the following 
# variable a personal access token (with scope "public_repo") for a GitHub user who 
# is a 'collaborator' of the repository "pagopa/io-functions-commons":
# - GITHUB_TOKEN
#
# To publish the package to the NPM registry you also need to set an auth token (with 
# "read and publish" access level) for a NPM user who is 'collaborator' of public package 
# "io-functions-commons": 
# - NPM_TOKEN
#

variables:
  NODE_VERSION: '10.14.1'
  YARN_CACHE_FOLDER: $(Pipeline.Workspace)/.yarn

# This pipeline can be manually run or is automatically triggered whenever one 
# of the following conditions is true:
# - a push is made to any branch in the repository (not only 'master')
# - a pull request is created
# - a tag named 'latest' is pushed
# Note. In the last case, the tag can be (re-)created using the Git CLI, e.g.:
#    git push -f origin <abfb967>:refs/tags/latest
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - '*'
      - refs/tags/latest

# This pipeline has been implemented to be run on hosted agent pools based both
# on 'windows' and 'ubuntu' virtual machine images and using the scripts defined
# in the package.json file. Since we are deploying on Azure Web app on Windows
# runtime, the pipeline is currently configured to use a Windows hosted image for
# verifying the build and deploying, and Linux OS for all other jobs for faster 
# execution.
